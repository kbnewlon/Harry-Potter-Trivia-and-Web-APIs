I have created an application that allow users to to test their Harry Potter knowledge. This interactive challenge produces a multiple choice quiz for the user. I created a starting page to introduce the user to the the instructions. Once the start button is clicked the array of questions and answers I have created is accessed. As the user makes their decisions for al 20 questions the array tracks their responses to then populate their score at the end. If the user gets questions wrong, their score will be subtracted by one point. If they get the answer correct their score will increase by one point.
